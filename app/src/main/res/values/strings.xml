    <string name="earth">Our home planet has a dense metal core,\na thick viscous rock mantle,\nand a thin crust.
                            \nIt\'s unique in the solar system for having humans\nand liquid water on its surface.</string>
    <string name="moon">At 3470 km in diameter, the Moon has the\nlongest moon-to-planet ratio.
        It\'s thought to\nhave formed when a small planet impacted\nEarth at a
        grazing angle billions of years\nago. It\'s heavily crated, and has huge\nflood plains on it called mania.</string>
    <string name="jupiter">A gas giant, it\'s the largest planet in\nour solar system. It has a dynamic\natmosphere,
                        including belts, zones,\nand a gigantic red spot created by a\npersistent hurricane. Its interior
                        is mostly\nmetallic hydrogen, and it has the fastest spin of all planets.</string>
    <string name="mercury">Orbiting the sun in just 89 days, it also has\nthe most elliptical orbit of any planet.
                        \nIt spins very slowly, once every 2/3\nof its orbital period. Despite its\n
                        surface reaching a blistering 430C,\nit still has water ice in permanently\nshadowed crates
                        near its poles\nwhere the temperature stays below -170C</string>
    <string name="sun">Our star is 2 octillion tons of hot hydrogen gas\nemitting 400 septillion of energy every
                        \nsecond. The hottest part of the sun is its 15\nmillion C core, when it\'s
                        been fusing hydrogen into helium for the past 4.6 billion years.\nDespite that
                        it\'s only midlife aged!</string>
